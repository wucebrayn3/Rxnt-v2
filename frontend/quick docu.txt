Proper component hierarchy:

Data will be stored in a state, data will always be changing and it is stored in a state as
it has to be updated and displayed constantly.

Updating a state within a component triggers a re-render, a reason for a proper component hierarchy.

Storing all and displaying all in a single component is light but will not scale.
Creating a proper component hierarchy will scale as loading each data and updating will be independent, meaning
that re-rendering will only occur on a specific item rather than reloading and re-rendering all items at once repeatedly.

Threads.jsx
    - contains all posts, comments and replies

Post.jsx
    - contains a single post item
    - contains Comments.jsx

Comments.jsx
    - contains all comments and nested comments

Reply.jsx
    - parent and non-parent items
    - only child components

Comment.jsx
    - contains single comment item
    - non-parent comment
    - will contain an empty component
    - contains Reply.jsx which will only be empty if the loaded comment has no replies
    - Reply.jsx will only appear inside based on condition to avoid mapping errors.

This way, updating a comment by replying to it will only trigger a re-render on the target item.

Creating a post calls Post.jsx
Creating a comment calls comments and calls comment.jsx

Infinite Scrolling:

load first batch
display 1st batch

scroll to last item in the current batch
load 2nd batch
display 2nd batch
show throbber / spinner while the next batch is being loaded for displaying

repeat process til 5th batch
scroll to last item in 5th batch
load 6th
display 6th
scroll into 6th
remove 1st batch
2nd batch becomes the new 1st batch
the 6th batch becomes the new 5th batch

repeat process when going further

scrolling back to top will reverse the process
scroll from 6th to fifth
remove 6th when out of sight
bring back original 1st batch
current 5th batch (6th batch) will be removed
